The Glasgow Haskell Compiler relies on the command line developer tools (gcc, ar, etc..). They can be installed as a part of Xcode, or via the "Command Line Tools for Xcode" package from http://developer.apple.com.

1990 - A committee formed by Simon Peyton-Jones, Paul Hudak, Philip Wadler, Ashton Kutcher, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals creates Haskell, a pure, non-strict, functional language. Haskell gets some resistance due to the complexity of using monads to control side effects. Wadler tries to appease critics by explaining that "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?"

    .orderBy(customer.lastName.asc(), customer.firstName.desc()) //asc() & desc() returns OrderSpecifier<T>

The first monadic law is that a monad is a wrapper around another type. In Haskell, one has the IO String type, which is returned from functions that read from files, console input, or system calls Ð IO is a monad that wraps the String data type. jQuery obviously satisfies this condition, as it wraps DOM nodes retrieved through given queries.
The second monadic law is just as simple: all monads must have a function to wrap themselves around other data types. jQuery clearly has ways to apply itself to DOM nodes Ð you use the querying facilities to traverse the DOM, and if youÕre feeling especially saucy, you can use pass the results of document.getElementsByTagName and its siblings to the jQuery object. Haskell refers to this as a type constructor Ð a function that takes some data and wraps that data inside a new type. (jQueryÕs type constructor is its parentheses.)
The third monadic law, and the only one thatÕs even remotely complicated, is that all monads must be able to feed the value or values that they wrap into another function, as long as that function eventually returns a monad. fadeIn(), text(), and all the other chainable functions are examples of this Ð they take the elements given inside the jQuery object, perform their function on them, then rewraps them back into the jQuery object and returns them.

    -- inject, wrapper
    return :: a -> m a

liftM f m = m >>= \i ->
            return (f i)

Because a monad can insert additional operations around a program's domain logic, monads can be considered a sort of aspect-oriented programming.[5]

* Konteksti
* Analogia: - Laatikko, jossa on kenkŠ. Ostettu laatikko vs. roskiin menevŠ laatikko.
            - Lift = nostetaan kenkŠ laatikosta. (+) toimii vain kengille, ei laatikoille
  + Laatikkoanalogia ei aina ihan kanna

When we started our journey to the top of Monad Mountain, we first looked at functors, which are for things that can be mapped over.
Then, we learned about improved functors called applicative functors, which allowed us to apply normal functions between several applicative values as well as to take a normal value and put it in some default context.
Finally, we introduced monads as improved applicative functors, which added the ability for these values with context to somehow be fed into normal functions.

So every monad is an applicative functor and every applicative functor is a functor.
The Applicative type class has a class constraint such that our type has to be an instance of Functor before we can make it an instance of Applicative.
But even though Monad should have the same constraint for Applicative, as every monad is an applicative functor, it doesn't, because the Monad type class was introduced to Haskell way before Applicative.
